<h1>i fell back asleep </h1>
<p>fall back to sleep
What a great question
different returns to rest
Fall back to sleep,
hear the thunder, open your eyes,
come out of a dream
Fall back to sleep 
look around 
return to a quiet night
Your response is private
If you fell back to sleep, 
To the best of my knowledge, you awoke </p>
